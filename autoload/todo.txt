
 - Todo

 * resize console window when buffer size changes
 * fix number syntax highlighting

 - Maybe hopeless

 * investigate mintty attach problems (or don't)
 * investigate "more" input problems

 - Finished

 X allow colors to be written to line more than once
 X slow subprocess loops to 1/sec when buffer is unfocused
 X use better way of determining if buffer length should be extended, e.g. cursor position
