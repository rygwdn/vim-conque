 -- Trivial --

 * send entire buffer contents to conque instead of just visual selection
 * check for paste mode
 * build shell script for automated performance profiling

 -- Non-Trivial --

 * check for resized window upon entering insert mode
 * re-review polling for a method which doesn't require leaving insert mode

 -- Probably Impossible --

 * scroll unfocused buffer



 -- ************************************* --

 x fix colors (see Issue)
 x allow pausing mappings so user can edit screen
 x send SIGWNCH on window resize
